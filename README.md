<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
<h2>üëã About The Project</h2>
<p>Welcome to my project!</p>
<p>This is an application for the historical educational platform StreetCode.com.ua, written in the SWIFT language and built on the SWIFTUI framework.</p>
<h3>A short introduction</h3>
<p>This is my first major and serious project that I'm working on entirely from scratch. I really didn't want to create just another to-do list or weather app for my PET-project, especially following internet guides. =)</p>
<p>So, I chose a more interesting and challenging task for myself, the results of which could bring real benefits to society. And since there are already many people working on the project, it's a fantastic opportunity to collaborate in a team, gain experience, and enhance my skills as an iOS developer.</p>

<p>Well, challenge accepted!</p>

<p>*This is a non-commercial project where I'm not earning money ‚Äì it's done on a volunteer basis.</p>
